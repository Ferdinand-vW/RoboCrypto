* Trend following indicators:

** moving average. Average price of asset for a period. Long-term trend followers use 
moving averages of 50,100 or even 200days Short term trend followers use days,hours or even minutes.
MA can help traders tell difference between a ranging and trending security. Ranging is when
the range between asset high and low prices for a period may vary considerably, but overall 
average is fairly consistent. If MA is mostly a horizontal line then asset is ranging. 
Alternatively, if moving average is rising, this signifies uptrend and if moving average is falling
this indicates downtrend.

*** Crossover strategy. Use two different moving averages, for example, 100 days and 25 days. When 
the smaller moving average cross above the larger moving average, then buy. When shorter moving average
crosses below the larger moving average then sell. Can also use price but if price is volate then shorter
duration crossovers using price can cause whipsaws (when price is moving in one direction but at some points
quickly pivots into the opposite direction).

** Moving average convergence divergence (MACD). Uses two moving averages and looks a the relationship between them.
MACD Line: 12-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) - 26 day EMA
Signal Line: 9-day EMA of MACD Line
MACD Histogram: MACD Line - Signal Line
The histogram grow larger as the speed of movement accelerates

** Relative Strength Index (RSI). Goal is to predict if asset is currently overbought or oversold.
RSI is a number between 0 and 100 which measures the magnitude of recent changes in a security price.
If RSI >= 70 then security is overbought. If RSI drops to <=30 then it is deemed oversold.
Convention is 14-period RSI. The periods can be long or short (monthly or 5minute periods). 4 steps for calculating:
1. bar-to-bar change of each close. Change = close_n - close_(n-1)
2. Smooth price changes using MA, SMA or EMA. If 14 periods, where 8 are 2% up and 6 are 1% down then
AvgUp = (2*8)/14 and AvgDown=(6*1)/14
3. Calculate relative strength (RS). RS = AvgUp/AvgDown
4. Compute RSI. RSI = 100 - (100/(1+RS))
